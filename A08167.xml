            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIr, I know you cannot be ignorant of the various reports ≈øpred abroad (throughout all the≈øe parts of Chri≈øtendome) of <hi>Count Mansfields</hi> being for the≈øe two monthes pa≈øt: Some affirming that hee is very weake; others, that he is very ≈øtrong: ≈øome, that hee ≈øhould be entertained by the French King, and that he ≈øhould be falne off from the Duke of <hi>Brun≈øwicke,</hi> vpon a breach betwixt them; and that there ≈øhould be a mutiny in their Army, whereupon they ≈øhould bee vtterly di≈øper≈øed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Count Mansfield</hi> being pa≈ø≈øed through <hi>Loraine,</hi> (where he payed for what he tooke, and commanded his Souldiers to forbeare doing any wrong, or taking any thing from any of the Duke of <hi>Loraines</hi> Subiects; notwith≈øtanding, at a place or two his Souldiers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ≈øome violence.) ariuing in <hi>Champaigne,</hi> made his Randeuow vpon the Frontier thereof, almo≈øt for this two monthes. In the meane time the French King made great preparation, as fearing le≈øt he ≈øhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3544:6"/> his Countrey: but vpon triall he found him to come not as an enemy, but as one who intended to doe him ≈øeruice, and did thereupon giue command to Duke <hi>Deniuers</hi> to treate with the ≈øaid C. <hi>Mansfield</hi> vpon certaine Articles or propo≈øitions, namely, on the Kings behalfe: <hi>Deniuers</hi> propounded vnto him both honors and profits, as that he would make him a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhall of France, and a Generall of certain forces which he would ≈øend for the recouery of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> that he would giue him 200000. Crownes in hand, and 20000. Crownes <hi>per annum. Mansfield</hi> on the other ≈øide was to bring to the Kings ≈øeruice of his Army 6000. foot, and 2000. Hor≈øe, which ≈øhould pre≈øently receiue pay of his Maie≈øty. But <hi>Mansfield</hi> hauing a farther reach (as by the ≈øequell appeares) intends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe by the ≈øaid treaty, but to get him≈øelfe more aduantage, and to preuent ≈øu≈øpition in the matters which he directly intended, namely, for the ioyning with the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> For being at a towne called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoon,</hi> on the Frontiers of France, hee gaue out of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe that <hi>Brun≈øwicke</hi> and he were fallen out, and that he was fallen from the ≈øaid Duke of <hi>Brun≈øwicke:</hi> and had ≈øecured him≈øelfe in the ≈øtrong Towne of <hi>Mo≈øoon,</hi> and would ioyne with the French King; by which policy, the way to <hi>Brabant</hi> was the more ≈øecure, and his enemy <hi>Gon≈øalo</hi> made the le≈ø≈øe ha≈øte after him: For this treaty of his with the French King, did ≈øo amaze his enemies that they knew no other but that hee would haue concluded with him, on the contrary you ≈øhall vnder≈øtand, about the 16 day of this month, in the night (hauing before ≈øelected out 6000. of his be≈øt hor≈øe, whereof 2. thou≈øand are Carabins or light
